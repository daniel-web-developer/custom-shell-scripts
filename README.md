# My custom Linux commands

To make my work easier, I've coded some simple shell scripts. Here's what each of them do:

## Glossary

- [Commands](#commands)
  - [cboilerplate](#cboilerplate) 
  - [cppboilerplate](#cppboilerplate) 
  - [cppboilerplateadvent](#cppboilerplateadvent) 
  - [changeresolution](#changeresolution) 
  - [createsassfiles](#createsassfiles) 

## Instructions

**How to set it up**: create a folder to store a(ll) file(s), make it an executable using `chmod +x FILE_NAME`, and add it to PATH. [Here's](https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/) a guide on how to do it.

**How to use the commands**: just time the name of the file (e.g. cboilerplate) on the terminal like this: `$ cboilerplate`.


## Commands

### cboilerplate

Creates a boilerplate file for C projects.

### cppboilerplate

Same thing, but for C++ instead.

### cppboilerplateadvent

Same thing as the above, but changed specifically to work with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

### changeresolution

This one isn't related to work, but just a simple script I created and used before I installed the NVIDIA drivers. Now the drivers automatically set my resolution to the one I prefer.

### createsassfiles

Creates all required Sass files and folders I usually use on my webdev projects.
